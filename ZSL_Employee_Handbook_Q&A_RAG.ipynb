(also referred to as the “Company”) employment policies, practices, guidelines and benefits. They\\nare not intended to create legally enforceable obligations on the part of the Company or its employees.\\nThe policies herein supersede and replace all previous personnel policies, practices, and guidelines that\\nare inconsistent with any of the provisions contained herein. The Company reserves full discretion to add\\nto, modify or delete provision of this Employee Handbook at any time and without advance notice. Any\\nwords or phrases used in this Employee handbook shall be interpreted by the Company in its sole and\\nexclusive discretion.\\n\\nTHIS HANDBOOK IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE EITHER AN EXPRESS OR AN IMPLIED CONTRACT OF\\nEMPLOYMENT. RATHER, IT IS INTENDED TO DESCRIBE THE COMPANY AND ITS PRESENT POLICIES\\nAND PROCEDURES. YOUR EMPLOYMENT AND COMPENSATION IS VOLUNTARY AND “AT WILL”,\\nMEANING THAT YOU AND/OR THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE RELATIONSHIP AT\\nANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE. EACH EMPLOYEE IS REQUESTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN\\nWRITING THEIR RECEIPT OF THESE POLICIES, THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT THE\\nHANDBOOK IS NOT INTENDED AS EITHER AN EXPRESS OR AN IMPLIED CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT,\\nAND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE EMPLOYED “AT-WILL”.\\n\\nNo representative of the Company, other than the Owner/Operator, has the authority to enter into any\\nagreement providing for your employment to be for a specified period or to make any agreement\\ncontrary to your “at will” employment status. Any agreement that deviates from your “at will”\\nemployment status must be in writing and signed by the Owner/Operator of the Company. No one has\\nthe authority to make any verbal statements which are legally binding on the Company with respect to\\naltering your “at will” employment status.\\n\\n* **OPEN DOOR POLICY**\\n\\nWe’re glad to have you at McDonald’s. As with any successful business, the success of the whole depends on each\\nmember doing his or her part. Every employee is important. Since our success depends on each person, it’s our\\ngoal that we grow together. The key element to growth is communication. Without it an atmosphere of\\nmisunderstanding, distrusts, and low productivity prevails which in the end affects the most important person in our\\nstores – the customer.\\n\\nTo avoid this from happening, you are strongly encouraged to discuss any concern you may have regarding your\\nemployment with McDonald’s by using the following Open Communication Policy:\\n\\n“If some aspect of your work or job function is causing you concern or in your opinion is unfair or unjust, you are\\nencouraged to discuss that matter with your immediate supervisor. If you feel you need an accommodation of some\\nkind to perform your job, please discuss this matter with your immediate supervisor. If after this discussion, you\\nfeel your problem is unresolved; you are encouraged to contact that person’s supervisor for a frank discussion.”\\n\\nThis is the sequence of communication or chain of command you should follow in your store:\\n\\n1. General Manager\\n2. Area Supervisor or Human Resource Representative\\n3. Owner/Operator\\n\\nAnything that you feel needs further attention or clarification, please follow the chain of command.\\n\\n* **DISCIPLINARY STATEMENT**\\n\\nViolations of policies will result in disciplinary actions. Disciplinary actions could include suspension or termination. It\\nis impossible for McDonald’s to anticipate every form of misconduct that may result in discipline up to and including\\ntermination. Discipline will vary according to the circumstances of a particular situation as determined solely by\\nMcDonald’s.\\n\\nIn situations where serious offenses have occurred or are suspected to have occurred (theft, unlawful acts, gross\\nmisbehavior, intoxication, substance abuse, sexual harassment, insubordination, etc.), it may be necessary to use an\\ninvestigation period. During this investigation period, you may be unscheduled. At the conclusion of this\\ninvestigation, a disciplinary determination will be made. Depending upon the results of the investigation, prior work\\nhistory, and the severity of the offense(s), the disciplinary action will range from a warning to a termination of\\nemployment.\\n\\n* **GROOMING POLICY**\\n\\nIt is McDonald’s policy to stress the highest standards possible in all phases of operations, including standards\\nregarding cleanliness and neatness. McDonald’s is a family restaurant and our employees must reflect this image.\\nExtreme hair color, tattoos, or other fads are not part of this image.\\n\\n• Piercings around the mouth will not be allowed. Nose piercing with any kind of hoop or ring is not allowed.\\nThe Area Supervisor must approve all other nose piercing. Eyebrow piercing must be small rings or studs\\nand have the Area Supervisor’s approval. Extreme stud piercing is not allowed. If you decide to get a new\\npiercing and cannot take out the piercing, you will have to take time off work until you can come to work\\nwithout the piercing.\\n\\n• Extreme tattoos must be covered. This will be enforced at the discretion of the General Manager or Area\\nSupervisor.\\n\\n• Fingernails must be short and well manicured. Fingernail length will be determined by the ability to perform\\nyour job functions. This includes being able to touch the touch screen of the register with the flesh part of\\nyour finger. This determination will be made by the General Manager or Area Supervisor.\\n\\n• Jewelry is permissible when worn in good taste and limited in size and amount. The Area Supervisor will\\nmake this determination. No bracelets or watches are allowed due to food safety issue. No large hoop or\\ndangle earrings due to food safety issues. There will be a maximum of 3 pierced earrings allowed in each\\near. Chains must be put inside of your uniform shirt.\\n\\n• Hair length for male and female employees should not overlap the collar of the uniform shirt. If it does, it\\nneeds to be pulled up and secured during working hours. All hairstyles and hair colors (natural colors)\\nshould be of a business nature and reflective of the corporate image. Hats must be worn at all times. Do-\\nrags are allowed under your crew hat, if they are black in color and the tails are tucked in.\\n\\n• Moustaches that are well trimmed and do not overlap the upper lip are allowed. Beards are prohibited.\\nSideburns and goatees are permissible; however, they should not extend below the earlobe and should be\\ngroomed to avoid becoming overgrown.\\n\\n• All employees must wear sturdy, black, polishable, non-slip shoes. Within 30 days, you must purchase or\\norder proper shoes. All canvas, nylon, sandals, or open toed shoes are not to be worn for safety reasons.\\nSocks must be worn. You may purchase “Shoes for Crew” and the full cost of your shoes will be deducted\\nfrom your paycheck.\\n\\n• Daily baths or showers are a very important part of personal hygiene, as is clean hair, brushed teeth and\\nthe use of deodorant. Moderate use of perfume cologne and cosmetics are essential.\\n\\n• A complete uniform includes a hat, clean uniform shirt, proper shoes, name badge, socks or hose, and\\nproper black pants. Pants cannot be yoga pants, sweat/athletic pants, tight-fitting pants, cargo pants or\\njeans. You will be responsible for coming to work in a clean and wrinkle free uniform. Pants may be altered\\nto reach the top of the shoe, however, no alterations to the style of the uniform are allowed. Pants needing\\nhemming should be brought to the office to be set out for repair at no cost to you. If you leave our\\nemployment, you must return all pieces of your uniform which would include 1 crew hat and 2 crew shirts.\\n\\n• In the cold weather, long sleeved shirts either red, black or white can be worn under your uniform shirt.\\n\\n• Reasonable accommodations to our grooming policies can be made to accommodate an employee’s religious\\nbeliefs or medical restrictions. Please speak with your General Manager.\\n\\n* **WORK SCHEDULE PROCEDURES**\\n\\n1. Availability to work\\n\\nYour work schedule will be set up to meet your needs, other employees’ needs, and the restaurant’s needs. If your\\navailability should change, please notify us in writing at least 2 weeks in advance of the change. Should your\\navailability change, your rate of pay MAY degrease or increase accordingly. Your schedule will not change until the\\nproper form is completed and signed. New employees cannot change their availability for 6 months unless there is a\\nspecific circumstance that must be approved in writing by the Area Supervisor.\\n\\n2. Time Off requests\\n\\nYou can ask for time off by submitting a written request at least 14 days in advance.\\n\\n3. Calling in procedures/emergencies\\n\\nIf you are ill and will not be able to work, we ask that you call and speak to a Manager at least 2 hours in advance\\nof the start of your shift. This must be done verbally – A TEXT MESSAGE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. If it is an early\\nmorning shift, we ask that you call the evening before and then in the morning again. This ensures that the\\nmessage is delivered. Calling in without a 2 hour notice will result in written documentation. Calling in sick when\\nyou are not sick or for an emergency when there is none is a terminable offence. If calling off is a continuous\\nproblem, there will be written documentation and discipline will result. All employees who are off work with a\\ndoctor’s note must have a doctor’s note stating they are able to return to work. This also applies to maternity leaves.\\nRequests for leave of absence must be in writing. See your General Manager for the correct form\\n\\n4. Tardiness\\n\\nBeing even a few minutes late places a burden on other employees. We know that there occasionally are reasons\\nwhy an employee is late for work. Please be courteous and call when you know you will be late. If this is a\\ncontinuous problem, there will be written documentation and discipline may result. Clocking in early for your shift\\nwithout management approval will result in documentation and discipline.\\n\\n5. Covering your shift\\n\\nShould you wish to change your shift once the schedule is posted, you must:\\n\\nA. find someone to work for you\\nB. The person who replaces you must have been trained to work the same position\\nC. You must make sure the change is approved by the shift manager for the shift you are replacing.\\n\\n6. No Call, No Show Policy\\n\\nShould you fail to call in or report to work for a scheduled shift, it will be considered a no-call no-show. A no-call\\nno-show means you have abandoned your job.\\n\\n7. Work Schedule\\n\\nOne of the greatest benefits at McDonald’s is flexibility in scheduling. McDonald’s is primarily a part-time\\nemployer and does not guarantee hours. We recognize 30 hours a week as full-time employment. From\\ntime to time, you may be asked to work on a shift when you are not scheduled. You will be paid a minimum of 3\\nhours for these shifts. However, your scheduled hours may have minimum of 2 hours. Your work schedule will be\\nset up to fit your needs, but will be affected by your availability, the availability of other employees, the restaurant\\nneeds and your overall performance and versatility. The more you know and the more hours you are available, you\\nincrease your chances to be scheduled more hours.\\n\\n* **NON-DISCRIMINATION & HARASSMENT POLICY**\\n\\nEEO Policy: Above all, the Company values a diverse workforce. The Company’s vision for diversity and\\ninclusion is to leverage the unique talents, strengths, and assets of our employees in order to provide the\\nworld’s best quick service restaurant experience. We continuously strive to maintain an environment in\\nwhich everyone fees valued, accepted, and rewarded as an integral part of the team. The company is an\\nequal opportunity employer and complies with all applicable federal, state and local fair employment\\npractices laws. The company provides opportunities for recruitment, employment training, development,\\nperformance reviews, pay advancement, and any other aspect of employment based solely on individual\\nabilities and job performance. This policy ensures a practice of equal employment opportunity regardless\\nof race, sex, religion, national origin, age disability, veteran status, weight or any other status protected\\nby Michigan, federal or local law.\\n\\nAmericans With Disabilities Act: The Company makes every effort to ensure that qualified individuals\\nwith a disability are not discriminated against with respect to the terms, conditions, or privileges of\\nemployment. The Company complies with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended by the\\nADA Amendments Act, and all applicable state or local law. Under certain circumstances, these laws\\nrequire employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities in\\nvarious aspects of their employment.\\n\\nConsistent with these requirements, the Company will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with\\na disability if such accommodation would allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the\\njob, unless doing so would create an undue hardship.\\n\\nAny employee or applicant who requires an accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job\\nshould contact the Store Manager, Supervisor, or Owner/Operator and request an accommodation. Once\\nthe Company is aware of the request for an accommodation, the Company will engage in an interactive\\nprocess to identify possible accommodations that will enable the applicant or employee to perform the\\nessential functions of the job. The Company will determine what limitation(s) may prevent the employee\\nfrom performing the job, and identify possible accommodations that may resolve the limitation(s). If the\\naccommodations are reasonable and do not impose undue hardship on the Company, or do not present a\\npossible direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace or to the individual, the necessary\\naccommodations may be granted. The interactive process described in this policy is a collaborative\\nprocess. An employee seeking an accommodation shall cooperate with the Company’s requests. The\\nCompany will also, where appropriate, provide reasonable accommodations for an employee’s religious\\nbeliefs or practices.\\n\\nNon-Discrimination & Harassment Policy: The Company strictly prohibits and does not tolerate\\ndiscrimination against employees, applicants or any other covered persons because of race, color,\\nreligion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender\\nnonconformity and status as a transgender or transsexual individual), age, physical or mental disability,\\ncitizenship, past, current or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic information, or any\\nother characteristic protected under applicable federal, Michigan or local law. All employees and\\nrepresentatives are prohibited from engaging in unlawful discrimination. This policy applies to all terms\\nand conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, training, promotion, discipline,\\ncompensation, benefits and termination of employment.\\n\\nUnlawful Harassment: All Company employees, other workers and representatives, including vendors,\\ncustomers, and other restaurant visitors are prohibited from harassing employees based on that\\nindividual’s sex or gender (including pregnancy and status as a transgender or transsexual individual) and\\nregardless of the harasser’s sex or gender.\\n\\nSexual harassment means any harassment based on someone’s sex or gender. It includes harassment\\nthat is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual’s sex or gender), as well\\nas any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any other conduct of a sexual nature,\\nwhen any of the following is true:\\n\\n• Submission to the advance, request or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or\\ncondition of employment.\\n\\n• Submission to or rejection of the advance, request or conduct is used as a basis for employment\\ndecisions.\\n\\n• Such advances, requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of substantially or unreasonable\\ninterfering with an employee’s work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive\\nwork environment.\\n\\nThe Company will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment, regardless of whether it is:\\n\\n• Verbal (for example, epithets, derogatory statements, slurs, sexually-related comments or jokes,\\nunwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors).\\n\\n• Physical (for example, assault or inappropriate physical contact).\\n\\n• Visual (for example, displaying sexually suggestive posters cartoons or drawings, sending\\ninappropriate adult-themed gifts, leering or making sexual gestures).\\n\\nThis list provides a few examples of conduct that may be considered harassment, but isn’t a complete\\nlist.\\n\\nThe Company’s anti-harassment policy applies equally to other forms of unlawful harassment, and all\\nharassment is prohibited both at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events. The company\\nstrictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful harassment against employees or any other covered\\npersons because of an employee’s race, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity,\\nsex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender nonconformity and status as a transgender or\\ntranssexual individual, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), age, physical or mental\\ndisability, citizenship, past, current or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic\\ninformation, or weight any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, Michigan or local\\nlaw.\\n\\nNo Retaliation: The Company strictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful retaliation against\\nany employee by any employee. All forms of unlawful retaliation are prohibited, including any form\\nof discipline, reprisal, intimidation or other form of retaliation for participating in any activity\\nprotected by law. Examples of protect activities include:\\n\\n• Lodging a good faith internal complaint (written or oral) with human resources or management\\nspecifically opposing unlawful discrimination or harassment, or complaining about violations of\\nwage and hour law (for example, if an employee believes he has been sexually harassed or not\\npaid overtime he is owed).\\n\\n• Filing a good faith complaint of unlawful discrimination or harassment with the US EEOC or in\\ncourt.\\n\\n• Participating in the Company’s internal investigation into allegations of sexual harassment.\\n\\n• Supporting another employee’s internal or administrative complaint of unlawful discrimination\\n(by, for example, testifying or providing an affidavit in support of a co-worker who has filed a\\ndiscrimination complaint with the EEOC).\\n\\n• Requesting an accommodation under the Americans With Disabilities Act or state anti-\\ndiscrimination statutes.\\n\\n• Requesting or taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or filing workers\\ncompensation claims.\\n\\nThe examples above are illustrative only, and not exhaustive. No form of retaliation for any\\nprotected activity will be tolerated.\\n\\nComplaint Procedure: The Company is committed to enforcing these policies. However, the\\neffectiveness of our efforts depends largely on individuals telling us about inappropriate workplace\\nconduct. If you feel as though you have been subjected to any conduct that you believe violates\\nthese non-discrimination, harassment, or retaliation policies, you must promptly contact your\\nrestaurant’s General Manager, or if you feel uncomfortable doing so, your Human Resources\\nRepresentative, Area Supervisor, or Owner/Operator as soon as possible after the offending conduct\\nat 734-374-8080.

These individuals will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted.\\n\\nYour complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and\\nany witnesses. The Company will directly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of\\nall claims of perceived discrimination and will take prompt corrective action, if appropriate.\\n\\nAny employee at the Shift Manager level or higher that observes retaliatory, harassing or\\ndiscriminatory conduct as described above must report the conduct to the General Manager, Human\\nResources Director, or Owner/Operator, so that an investigation can be made and corrective action\\ntaken, if appropriate. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action up to an including termination.\\n\\nIf you have any questions regarding this policy or questions about retaliation that are not addressed\\nin this policy, please contact your Owner/Operator.\\n\\nZero Tolerance: Any employee, regardless of position or title, whom the Company determines has\\nengaged in discriminatory, harassing, or retaliatory conduct in violation of this policy, will be subject\\nto discipline, up to and including termination of employment.\\n\\n* **SECURITY PROCEDURES**\\n\\nFor security and safety on the job, we have established security procedures to be followed by all employees.

The company\\nstrictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful harassment against employees or any other covered\\npersons because of an employee’s race, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity,\\nsex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender nonconformity and status as a transgender or\\ntranssexual individual, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), age, physical or mental\\ndisability, citizenship, past, current or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic\\ninformation, or weight any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, Michigan or local\\nlaw.\\n\\nNo Retaliation: The Company strictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful retaliation against\\nany employee by any employee.

This must be done verbally – A TEXT MESSAGE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. If it is an early\\nmorning shift, we ask that you call the evening before and then in the morning again. This ensures that the\\nmessage is delivered. Calling in without a 2 hour notice will result in written documentation. Calling in sick when\\nyou are not sick or for an emergency when there is none is a terminable offence.

McDonald’s is primarily a part-time\\nemployer and does not guarantee hours. We recognize 30 hours a week as full-time employment. From\\ntime to time, you may be asked to work on a shift when you are not scheduled. You will be paid a minimum of 3\\nhours for these shifts. However, your scheduled hours may have minimum of 2 hours. Your work schedule will be\\nset up to fit your needs, but will be affected by your availability, the availability of other employees, the restaurant\\nneeds and your overall performance and versatility. The more you know and the more hours you are available, you\\nincrease your chances to be scheduled more hours.\\n\\n* **',\n",
