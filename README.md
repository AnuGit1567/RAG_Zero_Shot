    <h1>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for Document Querying</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to extract and generate responses to specific user queries from structured documents, such as an Employee Handbook. The approach combines retrieval and generation stages to improve the relevance and specificity of responses, making it suitable for documents that contain dense, sectioned information.</p>
</div>

    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
    <h3>1. Text Extraction and Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>The input document, formatted as a structured PDF or text, is first parsed to extract full content along with designated section headers. A list of expected headers is predefined, serving as anchor points for each section's content. Using regular expressions, the model extracts the text between these headers, storing each section's text content in a structured JSON format:</p>
</div>      
  <pre><code>{
      "file_name": "EmployeeHandbook",
      "content": {
        "Section Name 1": "Text for section...",
        "Section Name 2": "Text for section...",
        // Additional sections...
      }
    }</code></pre>

    
<div>
    This JSON structure enables precise matching between the document’s structured information and user queries.
    <h3>2. Retrieval Mechanism</h3>
    A sparse or dense embedding-based retrieval algorithm is used to identify relevant document sections. For each user query, the retrieval component matches query terms with section names or their content. This matching utilizes a similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity for dense embeddings) to select the most relevant sections.
    The retrieved sections are concatenated and formatted as context for the generation phase. Retrieval precision is optimized by limiting matches to top-k sections, balancing retrieval relevance with context length constraints for generation.
<div>
    <h3>3. Generation Using Language Models</h3>
    The retrieved context is appended to the user’s query, creating a combined input. The generation model, in this case, Google Gen AI (<code>gemini-1.5-flash</code>), is invoked to produce a coherent and contextually accurate response. By feeding in both the query and the matched context, the model provides answers grounded in the document’s content.
</div>
<div>
    <h3>4. JSON Output and Response Formatting</h3>
    The generated response is structured and returned to the user in a JSON format, suitable for API responses or integration with frontend applications.

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    Libraries: Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
    <ul>
        <li><code>re</code> for regular expressions</li>
        <li><code>json</code> for JSON manipulation</li>
        <li>Google Gen AI SDK for model interaction (if using <code>gemini-1.5-flash</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    

</div>

</div> 

<div>
  <h3>Code Structure</h3>
    The key functions implemented are:
    <ol>
        <li><strong><code>extract_sections(full_text, sections)</code></strong>: Extracts document sections based on predefined headers.</li>
        <li><strong><code>retrieve_similar_sections(query, index, your_documents, k)</code></strong>: Retrieves top-k matching sections using similarity measures.</li>
        <li><strong><code>generate_response(query, index, your_documents)</code></strong>: Combines query and retrieved context, generating a response using the Gen AI model.</li>
    </ol>
</div>   
<div>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Parse and extract the document sections into JSON format.</li>
        <li>Execute <code>generate_response(query, index, your_documents)</code> with a user query. The function will retrieve relevant sections, format them, and pass them to the language model for a response.</li>
    </ol>
    
</div> 
<div>
    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    Potential improvements could include:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dense Retrieval</strong>: Incorporating vector embeddings for fine-grained retrieval precision.</li>
        <li><strong>Section Embeddings</strong>: Using section-level embeddings to refine context for highly similar sections.</li>
        <li><strong>Answer Post-processing</strong>: Post-process the generated text to enhance readability or perform additional filtering.</li>
    </ul>
